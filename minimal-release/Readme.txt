Hack-Minimal-Release: Blogger Post HTML Scraper & Backup Utility

This is a quick-and-hacky minimal release of the Blogger Post HTML Scraper & Backup Utility. It has a minimal footprint of around 2.3 MB in disk usage and is very easy to set up.

Disclaimer: This minimal release may not work on all computers. For a regular, more robust installation, we recommend using npm install for all packages in the project hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/ravisiyer/scrape-blogger-post. This will have a larger footprint of around 22.9 MB in disk usage, but will ensure all dependencies are correctly installed for your system. The choice of whether to use this quick-and-hacky minimal release installation OR the more robust 'npm install' installation is yours and should be based on your needs.
