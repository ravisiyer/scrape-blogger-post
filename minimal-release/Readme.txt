Hack-Minimal-Release: Blogger Post HTML Scraper & Backup Utility

This is a quick-and-hacky minimal release of the Blogger Post HTML Scraper & Backup Utility. It has a minimal footprint of around 2.3 MB in disk usage and is very easy to set up.

Disclaimer: This minimal release may not work on all computers. For a regular, more robust installation, we recommend using npm install for all packages in the project hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/ravisiyer/scrape-blogger-post. This will have a larger footprint of around 22.9 MB in disk usage, but will ensure all dependencies are correctly installed for your system. The choice of whether to use this quick-and-hacky minimal release installation OR the more robust 'npm install' installation is yours and should be based on your needs.

Setup Instructions for the Hack-Minimal-Release:

Unzip the downloaded scrape-blog-post-minimal-release.zip file.

The zip contains a final-dist folder with the scrapeBlogPost.js script and a node_modules directory.

Your setup is now complete. You can run the script from the command line by navigating to the final-dist directory.

How to Use the Script:

For detailed instructions on running the script, please refer to the "Usage" section in the main README.md file on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/ravisiyer/scrape-blogger-post/blob/main/README.md .
