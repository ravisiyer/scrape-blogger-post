Steps to create a minimal release:
1. Create an esbuild minified and bundled scrapeBlogPost.js (without yargs) in dist directory at project
   root level by running: npm run build. 
2. In minimal-release directory, create a final-dist directory.
3. Copy the above minified and bundled scrapeBlogPost.js (without yargs) from dist directory into 
   minimal-release/final-dist directory. 
4. Copy node_modules from only-yargs directory to minimal-release/final-dist directory. Note that
   only-yargs contents were created by running: npm install yargs in an empty directory outside the
   project directory and sub-directories.
5. Zip the final-dist directory and name the zip as: scrape-blog-post-minimal-release.zip
6. Delete the final-dist directory in minimal-release directory as it is not needed now.
7. The minimal-release directory should already have Readme.txt related to this minimal-release.

Contents of minimal-release directory after minimal release has been created by following above steps:
a) scrape-blog-post-minimal-release.zip
b) Readme.txt

The above contents should be uploaded to GitHub Release page to make a new 'pre-release'.
